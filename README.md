# darknet_ros
Installation steps:

1. If using a GPU, change line 41 in darknet_cv2.py to "libdarknet.so.gpu"
These .so files are generated by the original Darknet source code after "make" is invoked once cloned.
2. Download weights. They can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qdqrDnUqMejC94785giO8TWgir7P8sgr?usp=sharing
3. Place these weights into the weights directory
4. Line 16 in detection.py will also have to be corrected to point to the location of the package
